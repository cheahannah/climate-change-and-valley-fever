# Climate Change and Valley Fever (2021)
Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), Jupyter Notebooks

* Conducted statistical data research experiment to explore how different environmental aspects of climate change (ozone levels, particulate matter values, geographical drought data, temperature, and precipitation) affected the number of valley fever cases in the southwestern US
* Used an instrumental variable and 2-stage least squares regression to estimate the average treatment effect of ozone levels on the number of Valley Fever cases
* Compared a generalized linear model and Random Forest model to predict number of cases based on environmental factors
